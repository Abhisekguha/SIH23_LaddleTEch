**Problem Statement Title	**
Hot metal, Steel Ladle, and Scrap pot Tracking by auto-capturing the Ladle number and locations at SMS-1 and SMS-2.
**Description	**
The ladle is identified by the number painted manually on its outer surface. The ladle number has to be captured. The exact location and number of the ladle has to be tracked in real-time and feedback is to be given to the local server for display. The hot metal Ladle travels from the TLC pit area to the converter for charging liquid hot metal and back. Steel Ladle travels from the Ladle preparation bay with liquid steel to secondary metallurgy units i.e. LF-1, LF-2, RH, or Twin LF, and then to one of the Caster machines for casting into billets and back. Slag Pot travels from Converter to the Slag dumping area and back. Benefits of solving this issue are tracking of the ladles, timely changes in process based on the ladle history, calculation of ladle circulation times, ladle life, and ladle turnaround times.
